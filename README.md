# Stenoright
Windows based application to embed a ZIP in a photograph

## Building it yourself
To build, I recommend using [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/), although I recommend using one of the releases instead.

Additionally, it is used for the [releases](https://github.com/lyricalpaws/Stenoright/releases)
